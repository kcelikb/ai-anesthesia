# AI for Anesthesiology

This repository documents my structured learning journey into AI, machine learning, and prompt engineering with a focus on **clinical data in anesthesiology**.

It follows a phased, use-case-driven roadmap integrating:
- Python programming for data handling
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Clinical dataset exploration
- Reproducible, interpretable modeling

---

## ðŸ”§ Environment Setup

- `env_validation.ipynb`: Verifies local Python environment and package availability
- `environment.yml`: Conda environment specification for reproducibility

---

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

- `notebooks/`: All Jupyter notebooks grouped by week or project
- `logs/`: Weekly learning reflections and notes
- `data/`: Local datasets (small public samples only)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Build and document a working ML pipeline on healthcare data
- Explore real datasets like MIMIC-IV or CDC for anesthesia-relevant insights
- Apply prompt engineering for clinical reasoning and documentation support
- Develop modular notebooks for reproducible and auditable analysis

---

## âœ… Phase 1: Python & Data Foundations

- Week 1: Python core logic â€” functions, conditionals, loops
- Week 2: Lists, dictionaries, string ops, basic file I/O
- Week 3: Regex, file parsing, JSON/CSV handling
- Week 4: EDA mini-project on a clinical dataset

> Progress tracked weekly in `logs/` and Notion
