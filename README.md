# AI for Anesthesiology

This repository documents my structured learning journey into AI, machine learning, and prompt engineering with a focus on clinical data in anesthesiology. 

## Contents

- `env_validation.ipynb`: Environment check notebook to validate setup
- `environment.yml`: Conda environment specification
- Phase 1 notebooks and datasets (coming soon)

## Goals

- Build a working ML pipeline on healthcare data
- Explore MIMIC-IV and similar datasets for anesthesia-relevant insights
- Develop and share reproducible code and analysis notebooks
